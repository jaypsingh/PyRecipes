# PyRecipes

###Purpose
-------------------
Purpose of these small python 3 programs (lego blocks) is to demonstrates an efficient way to achieve a solution.
In programinng there is no wrong way, but it all boils down to the effiectiveness of the provided solution,
in terms of program complexity, execution speed and memory consumption.
The Programs will be divided based on functioanl area.

###Structure contins:
-------------------
1. .py files that are small python scripts to demonstrate a solution.
2. README.md : It contains the help file to use the tool.


###Dependency:
-----------
Python 3 should be installed on your system to run the python file.
I am working with Python 3.5.2 version. But ideally it should work with any python 3.
Please note that basic understanding of python is needed to understand the scripts.


### 1. Data Structue and Algorithim:
-------------


### 2. Strings and Texts:
--------------
#Str_n_Test_01 :
This program demonstrates how can we split the strings into fields when the deliminators and spcing are not consistent.
The split() method will not work for such cases.
Hence this program uses re.split() method which is more powerful and handles such oerations more elegently.

#Str_n_Test_02 :
This program addresses a common problem when we need to match at the start and end of a string.

#Str_n_Test_03 :
This program works with fnmatch() and fnmatchcase() methods. These two methods are very useful for string compraison with wildcard. If we need to use provide a simple solution to allow wildcards in data processing, this is a good way.

#Str_n_Test_04 :
This program demonstrates matching and searching the text pattern. Here we use regular expressions, nothing fancy, but since we are on the topic of strings lets review this too.
